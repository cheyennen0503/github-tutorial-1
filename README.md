## Git vs. GitHub

If you want to push changes to the repository then this is where `forking` comes into play. `Forking` someones repository gives you a copy of that persons remote repository to which you can change and push changes too. This does not push changes to the persons original repository, it specifically pushes to your remote repository that you forked from them. To fork a repository
